# PAI Python SDK


English \| [ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá](./README_CN.md)

The PAI Python SDK is provided by Alibaba Cloud\'s [Platform for Artificial Intelligence (PAI)](https://www.aliyun.com/product/bigdata/learn). It offers a user-friendly High-Level API, enabling machine learning engineers to easily train and deploy models on PAI using Python, streamlining the machine learning workflow.

## Installation üîß

Install the PAI Python SDK using the following command, which supports Python versions \>= 3.6 (it is recommended to use Python \>= 3.8):

```shell
python -m pip install alipai
```

## üìñ Documentation

Find detailed documentation, including API references and user guides, in the [docs](./docs/) directory or visit [PAI Python SDK Documentation](https://alipai.readthedocs.io/).

## üõ† Basic Usage

- Submit a custom training job

The following example demonstrates how to submit a custom training job to PAI:

```python
from pai.estimator import Estimator
from pai.image import retrieve

est = Estimator(
    # Retrieve the latest PyTorch image provided by PAI
    image_uri=retrieve(
        framework_name="PyTorch", framework_version="latest"
    ).image_uri,
    command="echo hello",
    # Optionally, specify the source_dir to upload your training code:
    # source_dir="./train_src",
    instance_type="ecs.c6.large",
)

# Submit the training job
est.fit()

print(est.model_data())
```

- Deploy Large Language Model

PAI provides numerous pretrained models that you can easily deploy using the PAI Python SDK:

```python
from pai.model import RegisteredModel

# Retrieve the QWen-7b model provided by PAI
qwen_model = RegisteredModel("qwen-7b-chat-lora", model_provider="pai")

# Deploy the model
p = qwen_model.deploy(service_name="qwen_service")

# Call the service
p.predict(
    data={
        "prompt": "How to install PyTorch?",
        "system_prompt": "Act like you are programmer with 5+ years of experience.",
        "temperature": 0.8,
    }
)
```
